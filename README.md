# QDSX Market Edition — Physics-Inspired Data Compression

This repo contains the **QDSX Market Edition v1** pack:

- `AAA_QDSX_MARKET_EDITION_v1.zip` — a ready-to-use folder with:
  - `qdsx_engine.py` (main compression engine)
  - `demo.txt` / `demo.txt.qdsx` (round-trip demo)
  - `QDSX_logs/` and README inside

QDSX is a small, single-file, **lossless compression engine** designed for
logs, JSON, CSV and other structured data.

If you’d like me to run QDSX on one of your datasets as a **small paid
pilot** (with a short written report of compression ratios and behaviour),
you can contact me via GitHub or email.
